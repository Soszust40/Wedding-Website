            <h2>How We Met</h2>
            <p>We met through a friend group that we made while we were both grocery baggers at a local store in high school. Shortly after, we began dating and the rest is history!</p>
            
            <h2>How we got engaged</h2>
            <p>We were settling into our Airbnb after a long 8 hour travel day from Florence to a small town just outside of Sorrento, Italy. We opened a bottle of wine and sat outside on the patio overlooking the Bay of Naples as the sun was setting right on the horizon in front of us. We were getting ready for dinner and as Katie went back out to the balcony, Jacob was down on a knee asking her to marry him.</p>
            
            <h2>Save the Date</h2>
            <p>We are so excited to celebrate our special day with you. Please browse our website for details on accommodations, registry, and our love story.</p>
