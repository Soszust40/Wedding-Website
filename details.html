                    <summary>What is the dress code?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We ask that you wear semi-formal to formal attire such as mid to floor length dresses, dressy jumpsuits, and suit and ties. The ceremony will be held outdoors on grass so please take this into consideration. Since we are next to Lake Manistique it can get a little chilly so a shawl or cardigan might be a good idea to have on you.</p>

                        <p>The ceremony will start at 4pm ET. We recommend getting there around 3:00 to 3:30pm to park and get into the venue with plenty of time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We are having an unplugged ceremony and kindly ask that you keep your cell phones in your purses or pockets during the full ceremony length. We have professional photos being taken throughout the day and would hate for your phone to be in photos. We will share photos of our ceremony once we get them.</p>
